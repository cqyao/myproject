<h1>H.Parsons Webpage Project</h1>
<h2>Server set-up</h2>
<text>I used MAMP as a server to host the website on my device. However, other servers should work as well.</text>
<text>To run the site, run 'npm run build' and go to localhost. The database will need to be populated with data. More information on the database structure and usage is in the Word document.</text>
